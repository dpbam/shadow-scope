            >Ostracods</a
          >
          are a type of small, shrimp-like crustacean that lives in freshwater
          and saltwater habitats all over the world. Although they are often
          mistaken for bugs or insects, ostracods are actually more closely
          related to crabs and lobsters. These hardy little creatures can
          survive in even the most hostile environments, such as hot springs and
          brine pools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ostracods have an exoskeleton, which means that their bodies are
          protected by a hard outer shell. This tough exterior helps them to
          ward off predators and withstand extreme changes in temperature and
          pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          While they only look like little beans, ostracods are actually quite
          strong and resilient creatures. They can swim through turbulent
          waters, withstand high salinity, and survive in environments with low
          oxygen. They are also capable of living in extremely cold
          temperatures, making them well-suited for polar regions and deep ocean
          depths.

          In this video taken by middle school students using our Shadow Scope,
          you can see several ostracods (and possibly a water flea or two; see
          our December blog post below) racing around in great detail. They look
          dark on the shadow scope because their shells are not translucent.

        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          What are ostracods, and where do they live in the world?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ostracods, sometimes called seed shrimp, have been around for eons!
          Their story began about 500 million years ago when they first appeared
          in the fossil record. They are small crustaceans, growing from 0.04
          inches (around 1 mm) all the way up to about 1.2 inches long and
          enclosing their entire body within a shell made of low-magnesium
          calcite.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make up for their soft parts not being protected by an internal
          skeleton, these critters move quickly, reproduce frequently, and rely
          on their hard outer shell for defense! It's no surprise, then, that
          these fascinating creatures are able to inhabit many water bodies all
          over the world!

          Ostracods use their powerful appendages to quickly move around and
          search for food in a given water source.

          How do ostracods eat, move, and reproduce in their world?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ostracods mainly feed on
          <a
            class="blog-hyperlink"
            href="https://aquaponicsadvisor.com/what-do-ostracods-eat/"
            >detritus, bacteria, mold, algae, diatoms, or other tiny
            particles</a
          >
          of organic matter. They catch prey by filtering water through their
          gills and then transporting it to their mouths with the help of fuzzy
          hairs that line the inside of their bivalve shells. When it comes to
          movement, ostracods rely on a pair of long legs or appendages stemming
          from inside their shell. However, some species also "walk" across
          surfaces using short antennae located near their heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          When ostracods want to mate and reproduce, male ostracods release
          pheromones into the water to attract nearby females - then both males
          and females will deposit eggs at the bottom of oceans or lakes. By
          understanding how these incredible organisms use different behaviors
          to survive, we can appreciate all the ways wild creatures interact
          with our planet!

          What is the importance of ostracods for study in the science world?
        </h4>
        <p>
          As one of the most diverse crustacean groups in freshwater bodies,
          research on freshwater ostracods provides a great insight into
          environmental conditions such as water quality, hydrology, and
          ecotoxicology. Recent research has focused on developing diagnostic
          tools for species identification. This highlights the practical
          applications of researching ostracods. What's more, researchers have
          been increasingly taking a special focus on freshwater species for
          better research findings - this helps us understand not only ostracods
          but also our ecosystems' health in greater depth.

          How can we learn more about these amazing creatures?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Learning more about ostracods is important because they play an
          essential role in the delicate balance of our ecosystem and offer a
          unique window into the past. There are many ways to study these great
          creatures, both within and outside the classroom. In school, students
          can dive into topics like taxonomy, physiology, and the evolution of
          the ostracods. Students can also explore how these animals move
          through water with paddle-like appendages or even gather food with
          specialized mouthparts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the school walls, students can further their education with
          hands-on activities such as studying water (and ostracod) samples with
          a homemade microscope (like our Shadow Scope!). Regardless of where
          they learn, students will be inspired by these amazing organisms and
          unlock new scientific knowledge and curiosity along the way!

        </div>
        <p>
          Have you ever seen a ciliate? These bizarre little creatures are
          actually pretty common, and you might have even eaten one or two
          without realizing it! Ciliates are microscopic organisms that move by
          wiggling their hundreds of microscopic hair-like cilia. In this blog
          post, we'll learn all about these amazing creatures - how they move,
          what they eat, and where they live. Ready to explore the world of
          ciliates? Let's dive, or should we say, swim like a ciliate in!
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          Ciliates are a group of protozoan species that are covered in cilia,
          which are tiny hair-like structures
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ciliates are an amazing group of single-celled organisms that have
          organelles called cilia - they are basically tiny hair-like
          projections that cover the surface of their bodies! Hundreds of
          ciliate species exist in this classification, and these fascinating
          creatures vary greatly in size and shape. Ciliates make up a vital
          component of aquatic food webs, providing nutrition to many species as
          microscopic particles are trapped by their swift-moving cilia. If you
          haven't seen a ciliate before, take some time to look up, research,
          and watch them - you might just fall in love with these extraordinary
          miniature explorers of our planet!

          Here, you can see a ciliate moving around randomly in search of food.
          This video was taken with one of our homemade shadow scopes, as
          described here.

        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          Ciliates use their cilia for locomotion and to find and capture food
          sources
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ciliates are actually members of a phylum called Ciliophora, and
          because of their undulating membranes full of microscopic hair-like
          structures, they can propel themselves forward. Clusters, tufts, or
          groups of these hairs are called cirri and allow the ciliates to do
          more than just move around - they use them to eat, too! Ciliates, who
          are also known as ciliated protozoa, feed on bacteria by using their
          cirri to capture their food sources. Often, around the mouth of a
          ciliate, the undulating membranes resemble fan-like or sheet-shaped
          groupings of cilia. These cilia help the organism move food into its
          mouth, which is also known as a cytostome.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          Some ciliates are free-living, while others form and live in symbiotic
          relationships with other organisms
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ciliates are really interesting organisms! Some of them are
          free-living, which means that they can live without being dependent on
          other organisms. Others form and live in symbiotic relationships with
          different organisms to survive.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          Ciliates also have several ways of reproducing
        </h4>
        <p>
          In addition to having two different ways of living, ciliates also have
          two different ways of reproducing: binary fission and sexual
          reproduction. They exchange their haploid micronuclei (or genetic
          material) with one another when they reproduce through the process
          known as conjugation. This is a very special type of nuclear
          reorganization because they undergo mitosis to make new genomes with
          this genetic material that gets exchanged!

        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          There are many different varieties and species of ciliates, each with
          its own unique set of features and evolutionary adaptations
        </h4>
        <p>
          Did you know that protozoa, and by extension, ciliates, are one of the
          most common groups of single-celled organisms on the planet? There is
          such a great range of species of ciliates out there, each with its own
          special set of features. For example, some ciliate's contractile
          vacuoles help to control the water levels within their body, while
          food vacuoles store nutrients from the organisms or materials they
          consume! One particular species of ciliate is Balantidium coli, and it
          can actually cause intestinal illnesses and discomfort in humans if
          they are exposed and subsequently infected. It's fascinating to think
          about how these minuscule single-celled creatures have adapted and
          evolved to live and thrive with such different lifestyles.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          Ciliates are a crucial component of the health of the global ecosystem
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ciliates play an important role in keeping our global ecosystem
          healthy! Ciliates are single-celled organisms that can also live in
          larger structures called colonies. They're incredibly diverse and can
          be found just about everywhere, from the depths of the ocean to the
          peaks of mountains. These tiny creatures consume bacteria, which helps
          to protect and keep our environment clean - in some respects, they're
          like little guardians of our planet Earth! What's even more incredible
          is that by providing food for fish, worms, and other aquatic
          creatures, ciliate colonies provide their nutrition to countless
          ecosystems. Ultimately, without ciliates, our global ecosystem
          wouldn't only be less diverse and as healthy as it is today, but it
          may also not have been possible to begin with!
        </p>

          What ciliates can you find in your Shadow Scope?
        </h4>
        <p>
          To sum it up, ciliates are an incredibly diverse and important group
          of protozoans that serve many important roles in ecosystems around the
          globe. With their multitude of evolutionary adaptations, they have
          been successful in surviving in a huge range of environments, from
          soil to freshwater rivers and saltwater oceans. Ciliates live in a
          massive variety of habitats as both solitary and symbiotic organisms.
          As vital members of the earth's aquatic food chains, these
          single-celled creatures form part of the delicate relationship between
          predator and prey. Ciliates play a number of crucial roles in their
          environments and offer unique opportunities for discovery and
          observation. We encourage you to grab your Shadow Scope and explore

        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">What is a water flea (daphnia)?</h4>
        <p>
          Water fleas, also known as daphnia, are a genus of small aquatic
          crustaceans that are great for studying freshwater ecosystems. They
          can be located all around the world, from the great lakes to smaller
          lakes and ponds. These tiny animals are common in North America and
          Europe. There are several species within this group, including Daphnia
          pulex, Daphnia magna, and Daphnia cucullata. While all the daphnia
          species within this genus share some traits, such as their size and
          segmented body shape, they also have distinct characteristics that
          make them unique.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, Daphnia pulex is known for being the first species of
          crustacean to have its genome sequenced, while Daphnia magna is
          typically found in less polluted freshwater lakes. All water fleas
          feed on microscopic organisms like algae, bacteria, or yeast and serve
          as an important live food source for many animals that thrive on
          freshwater lakes. Kids love to study these tiny creatures as it can
          easily be done at home with a sample taken from a shallow pond or lake
          nearby! So whether you're looking to explore your local ecosystem or
          if you're just looking for a great science project - investigating
          water flea daphnia with a shadow scope is always fun!
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          The physical features of the water flea daphnia
        </h5>
        <p>
          Water fleas are found in almost any body of freshwater, and the most
          well-studied species is Daphnia pulex. They reproduce quickly and can
          often be seen swimming on the surface of ponds. Water fleas have an
          easy-to-spot external anatomy consisting of a single compound eye (yes
          - they are a cyclops!), antennae, and a brood chamber that contains
          eggs or embryos. While they all look generally similar, one species -
          the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) - stands out with its
          extended tail spine that gives it an almost alien appearance. Water
          fleas come in a variety of colors due to their carapace pigmentation;
          these range from dark brown and green to orange, yellow, and even
          pink! Overall, the physical features of water fleas make them easily
          recognizable among aquatic life. These fascinating creatures are both
          incredibly abundant and incredibly diverse! ​​​​Their unique physical
          features help us better understand their life cycle as well as our own
          global environment.

          Microorganisms Everywhere
        </h5>
        <p>
          All water on Earth contains microscopic organisms, even if it looks
          clean. These tiny aquatic creatures are a vital part of the ecosystem
          and play a role in decomposing organic matter, filtering water, and
          providing food for other animals. While some microscopic organisms are
          harmful to humans and can cause diseases, others are actually
          beneficial. For example, certain microorganisms found in dirt help
          plants grow by enriching the soil through their natural biological
          processes.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          What the water flea daphnia eats
        </h5>
        <p>
          Water fleas (daphnia) are filter feeders, which means that they filter
          their environment for food. They primarily feed on bacteria and yeasts
          in their aquatic environment, but they will also consume single-celled
          algae and small organic particulates from decomposed plants. To filter
          their food, the water flea uses a set of unique antenna-like features
          called "bristles." These bristles create whirlpools that enable
          daphnia to capture and filter out edible particles from the water.
          Daphnia will then use these particles as a source of nutrition. Once
          consumed, the nutrients are used to grow tissue and produce energy for
          reproduction and movement. By eating what's available in their
          environment, water fleas help to keep the body of water clean and able
          to sustain other species that inhabit it. This is one of many
          fascinating behaviors that you can observe under the shadow scope
          while studying these creatures!
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          How the water flea daphnia lives and reproduces
        </h5>
        <p>
          The life cycle of the water flea, or daphnia, is quite fascinating!
          Daphnia starts life out as eggs that hatch in the spring when the
          water begins to warm and conditions are appropriate for them to
          survive. When these larvae hatch, they take in lots of food and molt
          their exoskeleton several times before reaching adulthood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adults can reproduce using a variety of means - one is called
          parthenogenesis. This happens when females lay eggs without mating
          with males. These fertile eggs then mature within a brood chamber made
          of hardened parts of the female's body called a carapace. As
          environmental conditions change, females will sometimes lay resting
          eggs that have protective shells so they can rest until optimal
          conditions return.
        </p>
        <p>
          They can remain dormant during stressful environmental conditions like
          drought and extreme temperatures but will hatch when more suitable
          conditions present themselves - making this tiny creature incredibly
          resilient!
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          The benefits of having water fleas in your pond or aquarium
        </h5>
        <p>
          If you have a pond or fish tank, adding a few water fleas, or daphnia,
          can bring loads of benefits! Not only do they provide food for larger
          animals like fish and frogs, but they also help to maintain the
          cleanliness and health of the environment. The tiny creatures act like
          natural filters in the water, trapping debris, bacteria, and other
          microorganisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          As if all that wasn't enough - these unsung heroes will help keep your
          pond or aquarium looking its best too! Daphnia feed on algae growths
          which can give your water a dull green hue and accumulate on surfaces
          over time. Thanks to the power of daphnia, your aquatic home may stay
          fresher and clearer.

          Fun facts about water fleas:
        </h5>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            Though they're very small, water fleas can actually be quite
            long-lived. Some individual water fleas have been known to live for
            up to one hundred days!
          </li>
          <li>
            Male water fleas can mate with females to produce eggs that can
            survive in harsh conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many people who keep fish practice daphnia culturing so they can use
            the fleas as a live food source for their pets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scientists also study water fleas because they are very sensitive to
            polluted water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Water fleas are also interesting because they can "evolve" like a
            pokemon for battle in the presence of predators. In other words,
            when they're around predators, they can grow horns and armor to
            protect themselves!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So the next time you're near a body of water, take a closer look - you
          might just see some tiny water fleas swimming around.

          A Fantastic Microscopic World
        </h5>
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered what's going on when looking at a drop of water
          under a microscope? It turns out that a whole world of activity is
          happening that you can't see with the naked eye. Using a traditional
          microscope or our shadow scope, you can ID certain microscopic life
          forms in a small water sample by their movement patterns. This can
          give you a much better picture of the underlying health of that
          particular water ecosystem. Water is essential for all life on Earth,
          and we need to be good stewards of this precious resource. By

          Microorganisms Everywhere
        </h5>
        <p>
          All water on Earth contains microscopic organisms, even if it looks
          clean. These tiny aquatic creatures are a vital part of the ecosystem
          and play a role in decomposing organic matter, filtering water, and

        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          How These Little Creatures Get Around
        </h5>
        <p>
          One of the most fascinating things about microscopic organisms is the
          way they move. Depending on the type of organism, they may use
          flagella, cilia, or pseudopods to get around.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Flagella</h5>
        <p>
          Flagella are long, whiplike appendages that some microscopic organisms
          use for propulsion. You may be familiar with flagella from studying
          bacteria in science class — many bacteria have a single flagellum at
          one end that they use to move about.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Cilia</h5>
        <p>
          Cilia are shorter than flagella and are often found in arrays along
          the sides of an organism's body. They can beat back and forth in
          unison to create a wave-like motion that propels the organism through
          its environment.

          Pseudopods are temporary extensions of an organism's body that it uses
          to catch prey or move along. Amoebas are a type of organism well-known
          for its use of pseudopods. If you've ever seen an amoeba moving,
          you've seen it using pseudopods to extend itself forward and engulf
          its prey.

          Rotifers are another type of small freshwater creature. They get their
          name from the wheel-like structures (called rotors) on either side of
          their head that they use for locomotion. Rotifers are scavengers and
          will eat just about anything smaller than themselves, including other

          Nematodes are one of the most diverse groups of creatures on Earth —
          there are an estimated 1 million species of nematode! They can be
          found in virtually every ecosystem on the planet, including freshwater
          ecosystems like ponds. Nematodes vary widely in size, but most measure
          less than 1mm long. Because they're so small, they often go unnoticed
          by us humans; however, they play an essential role in the food chain
          as predators and prey.
