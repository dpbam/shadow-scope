        </div>
        <p>On September 2, we gathered at the Wade the River event. We explored the incredible biodiversity of tiny aquatic life living within the Poudre. With nets and magnifying glasses in hand, we ventured into the depths of one of Colorado's most iconic rivers, armed with our curiosity and excitement to discover what secrets were hidden beneath its murky waters. </p>
        <p>By day's end, our Shadow Scopes were filled with images of squiggly specimens ranging from strange larvae to tiny worms as well as curious critters like leeches. The Shadow Scope microscope gave us an unprecedented peek at this smaller world. It allowed us to openly marvel at these unique forms of life seldom seen in such detail by human eyes!</p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">The Beauty Of The Poudre River</h4>
        <p>The beauty of aquatic life goes beyond its stunning presence - it plays a significant role in our ecosystem. Exploring aquatic life allows us to gain insights into the behavior and traits of various aquatic creatures. Recently, my family and I participated in the Wade the River event, which took place in our city and allowed me to explore the aquatic life thriving in the nearby river.</p>
        <p>This blog post is a detailed account of our journey into the river, the specialized tools we used to examine aquatic life, and a simple guide to proper sampling techniques.</p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">How The Day Started</h4>
        <p>Our journey through the river started with a walk along the trail near Lee Martinez Park. After our five-minute walk, we were quickly greeted by a friendly Wade the River staff member, who asked if we were there for the event.</p>
        <p>My family and I were given a few of the tools (magnifying glass, spoon) we needed to get started. We were given a nice explanation of how to begin sampling. The specialized magnifying glass was an eye-opener, allowing us to view aquatic life barely visible to the naked eye.</p>
        <p>One significant benefit of using the magnifying glass was how close it brought aquatic life to us; for the first time, we saw some of the details of creatures previously unknown to my family. The magnifying glass was so helpful that we could, for the most part, identify the creatures and even study their movements and behaviors.</p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">Using Horseshoe Nets</h4>
        <p>We used horseshoe-shaped nets to trap stirred-up particles to improve our sampling methods. The horseshoe-shaped net was a game-changer, and it helped us to capture almost every little creature that stirred up in the water. </p>
        <p>The nets were perfect for grabbing little creatures, allowing us to examine them more closely. The process illuminated how the creatures functioned and how they are a significant part of the river ecology that we take for granted.</p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">Using a Spoon And Syringe To Gather The Creatures</h4>
        <p>Next was identifying and isolating tiny creatures with a spoon and suction syringe. From little water bugs, worms, leeches, and fly larvae, we saw creatures we never knew or had forgotten existed.</p>
        <p>Using a spoon and suction syringe was a unique experience for us as we had to observe the creatures first to recognize the best spot to retrieve them without causing any harm. Isolating the creatures with a spoon and syringe allowed us to understand the river's biodiversity.</p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">Using The Shadow Scope</h4>
        <p>The Shadow Scope, a specialized microscope, served as our window into the unseen world of the river depths. CSU researchers provided expert guidance on this innovative tool, allowing us to capture excellent videos of our river samples.</p>
        <p>With their help, we recorded fascinating images of insect larvae, flatworms, and mayfly larvae. The Shadow Scope brought the river's microcosm to life, transforming abstract concepts into tangible pictures and video clips.</p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">Videos Taken With The Shadow Scope</h4>
        <p>The videos below were taken with our Shadow Scopes at the event. We’ve listed a few here, but you can find the full list from the link below. You’ll also be able to access them from our website soon!</p>

        <p>The majority of <a class="blog-hyperlink" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5LtFNcAsLZhftqBeYoN240fKSqga3AOl&si=pZ-VjJgyL_zjvSev" target="_blank">these videos show macroinvertebrates found in the Poudre River</a>, but also many varieties of flies, such as mayflies, stone flies, and caddis flies.</p>
        <p>The presence of all these flies indicates the river is clean and healthy. Touching on the river’s health, we learned at the event that the City of Fort Collins Water Team routinely checks on the Poudre River’s health each month at over ten different locations in town! In addition to all these flies, we also discovered many midge larvae (bloodworms) and planarians (flatworms), known for being more robust than fly larvae.</p>
        <p>We also got a chance to find a few varieties of microscopic organisms! We spotted ciliates, ostracods, daphnia (water fleas), and rotifers. The participants were even lucky enough to find a tiny fish larva, likely from a trout. </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">Newfound Knowledge of Nature</h4>
        <p>My family and I gained valuable knowledge about nature and its intricate workings from the event. The event provided clear, tangible examples of ecological concepts that we often only read about. </p>
        <p>Most importantly, the event underscored the significance of continuous learning and exploration, reminding us that nature has endless lessons to teach us. My children absolutely loved being in the water and finding all sorts of creatures they had never seen before. Seeing them up close was even more exciting!</p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">Admiration for the Poudre River's Health and Biodiversity</h4>
        <p>The diversity of aquatic life in the river was nothing short of awe-inspiring. From minuscule microorganisms to larger species such as flatworms and stoneflies, the river teemed with a vibrant array of lifeforms, each vital in maintaining the river's ecosystem.</p>
        <p>This experience underscored the importance of preserving and respecting our natural habitats. Each organism in the Poudre River had a purpose, contributing to the ecosystem's delicate balance.</p>
        <p>Participating in the 'Wade the River' event was an educational experience and a testament to the extraordinary beauty of nature and the marvels of aquatic life.</p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">Reflecting on Our Day At The Poudre River</h4>
        <p>Reflecting on the 'Wade the River' event, it was an immersive journey into the heart of nature, offering profound insights into the aquatic life that thrives in our local river. The event also highlighted the role of community involvement in ecological research, encouraging an active dialogue between the public and the scientific community. The hands-on experience, the valuable knowledge gained, and the deep appreciation for nature fostered by the event are the key takeaways that will continue to resonate with me and my family. Through events like these, we learn about our environment and understand our role in preserving and protecting it for future generations.</p>
        <p>We encourage all our participants to feel free to share their videos online and add the hashtag <strong>#CSUShadowScope</strong> so everyone can see it!</p>

          <h3>Shadow Scope: Shadows Donuts and the Arago Spot</h3>
          <h4>May 1, 2023</h4>
        </span>
        <div class="derek-blogone">

        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">Find Out About How Light Interacts With Organisms In The Shadow Scope</h4>
        <p>
         Welcome to the strange and fascinating world of the Shadow Scope! Imagine the shadow of a tiny microscopic creature. What does it look like? Turns out, it’s a bit different than your shadow. With the Shadow Scope, you can see such shadows and use them to explore the environment on a much smaller scale.  
        </p>
        <p>In this blog, we'll learn what makes a microscopic shadow, observe incredible images created by them in action, learn why they exist in our world, and discover how far science has come in providing us with unique ways to view our environment! </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">Introducing the Shadow Scope and its purpose</h4>
        <p>Have you ever heard of a <a class="blog-hyperlink" href="https://stasevichlab.colostate.edu/shadow-scope/html/history.html" target="_blank">microscope</a> that can detect shadows of microscopic organisms on a chip? Well, the Shadow Scope is exactly that! This homemade microscope casts shadows of these little critters, allowing us to observe them in detail. </p>
        <p>The shadows are particularly interesting, though, because of the wave nature of light, making them look a bit different than what we'd expect. If you look at the camera of this microscope, you'll get an amazing glimpse into the world at such a tiny scale. </p>
        <p>This will help us to better understand this unseen environment and discover new facts about our world.</p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">Explaining how shadow donuts (holograms of microscopic creatures) are formed and why they are interesting</h4>
        <p>If you've been learning how light works, you may have heard of something called a "shadow donut," a circular object with a bright point in the center. In the video below, you can see the shadow of many microscopic organisms in action: </p>
        <iframe
          class="blog-video"
          width="560"
          height="315"

        ></iframe>
        <p>The big guy moving about is a ciliate, as we described in a previous blog (<a class="blog-hyperlink" href="#ciliates">link</a>). But what about all the other things moving about? Why do their shadows all appear like little donuts?
To explain it, one must understand the wave theory of light! When a microscopic organism passes through the sample area of a Shadow Scope (a homemade microscope), wave-like shadows are cast onto the chip. These shadows can take on interesting shapes due to the interference of the light waves. For very tiny creatures, the light waves interfere with one another to form a circular shadow with a bright spot in the center and rings off to the sides, in essence creating ‘shadow donuts’. The size of the central shadow donut hole and its width relative to the ring edge give information about where the microscopic organism is in the z-direction (the direction that is perpendicular to the plane of the image). Thus, the shape and size of the shadow donut can be used to reconstruct the 3D position of the microscopic organism! Since 3D information is encoded in a 2D shadow donut image, the shadows are called holograms. 
</p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">Scientifically explore the Shadow Scope and how it uses shadow donuts (holograms of microscopic creatures) and the phenomenon known as the Arago Spot</h4>
        <p>Exploring nature with the Shadow Scope is an amazing opportunity to use the power of science. When light makes a shadow of a creature, it creates an <a class="blog-hyperlink" href="https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.13681" target="_blank">Arago Spot</a> (or Poisson's Spot) - a diffraction pattern of shadows created when microscopic creatures are illuminated and projected onto a chip.</p>
        <p>So, what exactly is the Arago Spot? Did you know that when light passes by a circular object, something magical happens? It creates this special spot called the Arago spot! The object makes the light diffract (<a class="blog-hyperlink" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/fresnel-diffraction" target="_blank">Fresnel diffraction</a>) and spread behind the object, creating a super cool effect - donut shadows. </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">The History of the Arago Spot</h4>
        <p>In the world of science, there are few things more thrilling than a discovery that goes against conventional wisdom. That's exactly what happened with the shadow donut, a phenomenon that started as a competition between university researchers at the French Academy Of Sciences in 1818. When Arago arrived at a theory, it was met with skepticism by his colleague, Poisson. Poisson was another member of the committee who believed Arago’s theory had to be false. The head of the committee, Arago himself, conducted the experiment using a tiny 2 mm metallic disk molded to a glass plate with wax. </p>
        <p>The result of the experiment? A bright spot in the center of the shadow that proved Arago's theory right. This discovery was a major breakthrough in the study of light, proving that the wave nature of light was indeed accurate. It's fascinating to see how a simple competition sparked such an important scientific discovery.</p>
        <p>In the case of specimens viewed with a Shadow Scope, the wave nature of light creates little 'donuts' or holograms that can be studied. These patterns offer us a glimpse into the microscopic world and provide scientists with a different and exciting way to study organisms and their behavior.</p>
        <p>So next time you see a shadow, remember that there's more to it than meets the eye!</p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">Analyzing the results of studying microscopic organisms with a shadow scope</h4>
        <p>Studying microscopic organisms with the Shadow Scope can yield some interesting results! 
        <p>When light is shone through a small sample and displayed on a chip, the shadows of organisms can appear very strange. </p>
        <p>Specifically, the shadow seen through the Shadow Scope can be thought of as a “bullseye.” This bullseye helps to pinpoint the exact position of microscopic organisms, so their mobility can be measured with great detail.</p>
        <p>Every organism casts its own unique shadow, and by studying these shadows, we are able to observe a newfound perspective on how these tiny creatures look and move. It's like looking at them through brand-new eyes!</p>

          Did you know that there is a tiny worm called C. elegans that has
          helped researchers understand a lot about how animals work? In this
          blog post, we'll learn all about what makes C. elegans so special and
          why it's important for scientists to study them. Get ready to be wowed
          by these amazing little creatures!
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          C. elegans is a type of nematode, or roundworm
        </h4>
        <p>
          If you've heard of Caenorhabditis elegans, or C. elegans for short,
          you know it's an incredible little creature! C. elegans is a type of
          roundworm - one that looks like a long tube with about 1000 cells
          (specifically, 959 somatic cells in the C. elegans fertilizing
          hermaphrodite), including neurons, and can grow in many types of
          places. It's been studied intensively by scientists because it has
          unique characteristics that make it a great model organism to study!
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, even though C. elegans is only 1mm long on average,
          scientists have learned so much from studying it – from how bodies
          develop to how cells age and die and more. This unique creature moves
          in a fascinating "wave-like" pattern when disturbed.

          >
          are a type of small, shrimp-like crustacean that lives in freshwater
          and saltwater habitats all over the world. Although they are often
          mistaken for bugs or insects, ostracods are actually more closely
          related to crabs and lobsters. These hardy little creatures can
          survive in even the most hostile environments, such as hot springs and
          brine pools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ostracods have an exoskeleton, which means that their bodies are
          protected by a hard outer shell. This tough exterior helps them to
          ward off predators and withstand extreme changes in temperature and
          pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          While they only look like little beans, ostracods are actually quite
          strong and resilient creatures. They can swim through turbulent
          waters, withstand high salinity, and survive in environments with low
          oxygen. They are also capable of living in extremely cold
          temperatures, making them well-suited for polar regions and deep ocean
          depths.

          What are ostracods, and where do they live in the world?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ostracods, sometimes called seed shrimp, have been around for eons!
          Their story began about 500 million years ago when they first appeared
          in the fossil record. They are small crustaceans, growing from 0.04
          inches (around 1 mm) all the way up to about 1.2 inches long and
          enclosing their entire body within a shell made of low-magnesium
          calcite.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make up for their soft parts not being protected by an internal
          skeleton, these critters move quickly, reproduce frequently, and rely
          on their hard outer shell for defense! It's no surprise, then, that
          these fascinating creatures are able to inhabit many water bodies all
          over the world!

            particles</a
          >
          of organic matter. They catch prey by filtering water through their
          gills and then transporting it to their mouths with the help of fuzzy
          hairs that line the inside of their bivalve shells. When it comes to
          movement, ostracods rely on a pair of long legs or appendages stemming
          from inside their shell. However, some species also "walk" across
          surfaces using short antennae located near their heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          When ostracods want to mate and reproduce, male ostracods release
          pheromones into the water to attract nearby females - then both males
          and females will deposit eggs at the bottom of oceans or lakes. By
          understanding how these incredible organisms use different behaviors
          to survive, we can appreciate all the ways wild creatures interact
          with our planet!

          Have you ever seen a ciliate? These bizarre little creatures are
          actually pretty common, and you might have even eaten one or two
          without realizing it! Ciliates are microscopic organisms that move by
          wiggling their hundreds of microscopic hair-like cilia. In this blog
          post, we'll learn all about these amazing creatures - how they move,
          what they eat, and where they live. Ready to explore the world of
          ciliates? Let's dive, or should we say, swim like a ciliate in!
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          Ciliates are a group of protozoan species that are covered in cilia,
          which are tiny hair-like structures
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ciliates are an amazing group of single-celled organisms that have
          organelles called cilia - they are basically tiny hair-like
          projections that cover the surface of their bodies! Hundreds of
          ciliate species exist in this classification, and these fascinating
          creatures vary greatly in size and shape. Ciliates make up a vital
          component of aquatic food webs, providing nutrition to many species as
          microscopic particles are trapped by their swift-moving cilia. If you
          haven't seen a ciliate before, take some time to look up, research,
          and watch them - you might just fall in love with these extraordinary
          miniature explorers of our planet!

        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          Ciliates use their cilia for locomotion and to find and capture food
          sources
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ciliates are actually members of a phylum called Ciliophora, and
          because of their undulating membranes full of microscopic hair-like
          structures, they can propel themselves forward. Clusters, tufts, or
          groups of these hairs are called cirri and allow the ciliates to do
          more than just move around - they use them to eat, too! Ciliates, who
          are also known as ciliated protozoa, feed on bacteria by using their
          cirri to capture their food sources. Often, around the mouth of a
          ciliate, the undulating membranes resemble fan-like or sheet-shaped
          groupings of cilia. These cilia help the organism move food into its
          mouth, which is also known as a cytostome.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          Some ciliates are free-living, while others form and live in symbiotic
          relationships with other organisms
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ciliates are really interesting organisms! Some of them are
          free-living, which means that they can live without being dependent on
          other organisms. Others form and live in symbiotic relationships with
          different organisms to survive.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          Ciliates also have several ways of reproducing
        </h4>
        <p>
          In addition to having two different ways of living, ciliates also have
          two different ways of reproducing: binary fission and sexual
          reproduction. They exchange their haploid micronuclei (or genetic
          material) with one another when they reproduce through the process
          known as conjugation. This is a very special type of nuclear
          reorganization because they undergo mitosis to make new genomes with
          this genetic material that gets exchanged!

          This ciliate is clearly displaying its hundreds of hair-like
          structures across the surface of its body.
        </h6>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          There are many different varieties and species of ciliates, each with
          its own unique set of features and evolutionary adaptations
        </h4>
        <p>
          Did you know that protozoa, and by extension, ciliates, are one of the
          most common groups of single-celled organisms on the planet? There is
          such a great range of species of ciliates out there, each with its own
          special set of features. For example, some ciliate's contractile
          vacuoles help to control the water levels within their body, while
          food vacuoles store nutrients from the organisms or materials they
          consume! One particular species of ciliate is Balantidium coli, and it
          can actually cause intestinal illnesses and discomfort in humans if
          they are exposed and subsequently infected. It's fascinating to think
          about how these minuscule single-celled creatures have adapted and
          evolved to live and thrive with such different lifestyles.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          Ciliates are a crucial component of the health of the global ecosystem
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ciliates play an important role in keeping our global ecosystem
          healthy! Ciliates are single-celled organisms that can also live in
          larger structures called colonies. They're incredibly diverse and can
          be found just about everywhere, from the depths of the ocean to the
          peaks of mountains. These tiny creatures consume bacteria, which helps
          to protect and keep our environment clean - in some respects, they're
          like little guardians of our planet Earth! What's even more incredible
          is that by providing food for fish, worms, and other aquatic
          creatures, ciliate colonies provide their nutrition to countless
          ecosystems. Ultimately, without ciliates, our global ecosystem
          wouldn't only be less diverse and as healthy as it is today, but it
          may also not have been possible to begin with!
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">
          What ciliates can you find in your Shadow Scope?
        </h4>
        <p>
          To sum it up, ciliates are an incredibly diverse and important group
          of protozoans that serve many important roles in ecosystems around the
          globe. With their multitude of evolutionary adaptations, they have
          been successful in surviving in a huge range of environments, from
          soil to freshwater rivers and saltwater oceans. Ciliates live in a
          massive variety of habitats as both solitary and symbiotic organisms.
          As vital members of the earth's aquatic food chains, these
          single-celled creatures form part of the delicate relationship between
          predator and prey. Ciliates play a number of crucial roles in their
          environments and offer unique opportunities for discovery and
          observation. We encourage you to grab your Shadow Scope and explore
          your own underwater world up close! Who knows what amazing varieties

        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">What is a water flea (daphnia)?</h4>
        <p>
          Water fleas, also known as daphnia, are a genus of small aquatic
          crustaceans that are great for studying freshwater ecosystems. They
          can be located all around the world, from the great lakes to smaller
          lakes and ponds. These tiny animals are common in North America and
          Europe. There are several species within this group, including Daphnia
          pulex, Daphnia magna, and Daphnia cucullata. While all the daphnia
          species within this genus share some traits, such as their size and
          segmented body shape, they also have distinct characteristics that
          make them unique.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, Daphnia pulex is known for being the first species of
          crustacean to have its genome sequenced, while Daphnia magna is
          typically found in less polluted freshwater lakes. All water fleas
          feed on microscopic organisms like algae, bacteria, or yeast and serve
          as an important live food source for many animals that thrive on
          freshwater lakes. Kids love to study these tiny creatures as it can
          easily be done at home with a sample taken from a shallow pond or lake
          nearby! So whether you're looking to explore your local ecosystem or
          if you're just looking for a great science project - investigating
          water flea daphnia with a shadow scope is always fun!
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          The physical features of the water flea daphnia
        </h5>
        <p>
          Water fleas are found in almost any body of freshwater, and the most
          well-studied species is Daphnia pulex. They reproduce quickly and can
          often be seen swimming on the surface of ponds. Water fleas have an
          easy-to-spot external anatomy consisting of a single compound eye (yes
          - they are a cyclops!), antennae, and a brood chamber that contains
          eggs or embryos. While they all look generally similar, one species -
          the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) - stands out with its
          extended tail spine that gives it an almost alien appearance. Water
          fleas come in a variety of colors due to their carapace pigmentation;
          these range from dark brown and green to orange, yellow, and even
          pink! Overall, the physical features of water fleas make them easily
          recognizable among aquatic life. These fascinating creatures are both
          incredibly abundant and incredibly diverse! ​​​​Their unique physical
          features help us better understand their life cycle as well as our own
          global environment.

        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          Microorganisms Everywhere
        </h5>
        <p>
          All water on Earth contains microscopic organisms, even if it looks
          clean. These tiny aquatic creatures are a vital part of the ecosystem
          and play a role in decomposing organic matter, filtering water, and
          providing food for other animals. While some microscopic organisms are
          harmful to humans and can cause diseases, others are actually
          beneficial. For example, certain microorganisms found in dirt help
          plants grow by enriching the soil through their natural biological
          processes.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          What the water flea daphnia eats
        </h5>
        <p>
          Water fleas (daphnia) are filter feeders, which means that they filter
          their environment for food. They primarily feed on bacteria and yeasts
          in their aquatic environment, but they will also consume single-celled
          algae and small organic particulates from decomposed plants. To filter
          their food, the water flea uses a set of unique antenna-like features
          called "bristles." These bristles create whirlpools that enable
          daphnia to capture and filter out edible particles from the water.
          Daphnia will then use these particles as a source of nutrition. Once
          consumed, the nutrients are used to grow tissue and produce energy for
          reproduction and movement. By eating what's available in their
          environment, water fleas help to keep the body of water clean and able
          to sustain other species that inhabit it. This is one of many
          fascinating behaviors that you can observe under the shadow scope
          while studying these creatures!
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          How the water flea daphnia lives and reproduces
        </h5>
        <p>
          The life cycle of the water flea, or daphnia, is quite fascinating!
          Daphnia starts life out as eggs that hatch in the spring when the
          water begins to warm and conditions are appropriate for them to
          survive. When these larvae hatch, they take in lots of food and molt
          their exoskeleton several times before reaching adulthood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adults can reproduce using a variety of means - one is called
          parthenogenesis. This happens when females lay eggs without mating
          with males. These fertile eggs then mature within a brood chamber made
          of hardened parts of the female's body called a carapace. As
          environmental conditions change, females will sometimes lay resting
          eggs that have protective shells so they can rest until optimal
          conditions return.
        </p>
        <p>
          They can remain dormant during stressful environmental conditions like
          drought and extreme temperatures but will hatch when more suitable
          conditions present themselves - making this tiny creature incredibly
          resilient!
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          The benefits of having water fleas in your pond or aquarium
        </h5>
        <p>
          If you have a pond or fish tank, adding a few water fleas, or daphnia,
          can bring loads of benefits! Not only do they provide food for larger
          animals like fish and frogs, but they also help to maintain the
          cleanliness and health of the environment. The tiny creatures act like
          natural filters in the water, trapping debris, bacteria, and other
          microorganisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          As if all that wasn't enough - these unsung heroes will help keep your
          pond or aquarium looking its best too! Daphnia feed on algae growths
          which can give your water a dull green hue and accumulate on surfaces
          over time. Thanks to the power of daphnia, your aquatic home may stay
          fresher and clearer.

          Fun facts about water fleas:
        </h5>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            Though they're very small, water fleas can actually be quite
            long-lived. Some individual water fleas have been known to live for
            up to one hundred days!
          </li>
          <li>
            Male water fleas can mate with females to produce eggs that can
            survive in harsh conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many people who keep fish practice daphnia culturing so they can use
            the fleas as a live food source for their pets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scientists also study water fleas because they are very sensitive to
            polluted water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Water fleas are also interesting because they can "evolve" like a
            pokemon for battle in the presence of predators. In other words,
            when they're around predators, they can grow horns and armor to
            protect themselves!

          give you a much better picture of the underlying health of that
          particular water ecosystem. Water is essential for all life on Earth,
          and we need to be good stewards of this precious resource. By
          understanding the microscopic world in a drop of water, we can learn
          more about how to protect our planet and its many diverse ecosystems.

          Microorganisms Everywhere
        </h5>
        <p>
          All water on Earth contains microscopic organisms, even if it looks
          clean. These tiny aquatic creatures are a vital part of the ecosystem
          and play a role in decomposing organic matter, filtering water, and
          providing food for other animals. While some microscopic organisms are
          harmful to humans and can cause diseases, others are actually
          beneficial. For example, certain microorganisms found in dirt help
          plants grow by enriching the soil through their natural biological
          processes.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          How These Little Creatures Get Around
        </h5>
        <p>
          One of the most fascinating things about microscopic organisms is the
          way they move. Depending on the type of organism, they may use
          flagella, cilia, or pseudopods to get around.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Flagella</h5>
        <p>
          Flagella are long, whiplike appendages that some microscopic organisms
          use for propulsion. You may be familiar with flagella from studying
          bacteria in science class — many bacteria have a single flagellum at
          one end that they use to move about.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Cilia</h5>
        <p>
          Cilia are shorter than flagella and are often found in arrays along
          the sides of an organism's body. They can beat back and forth in
          unison to create a wave-like motion that propels the organism through
          its environment.

          In this example video taken on a shadow scope, can you see where the
          flagella are and how they move? Hint, this organism is a stentor!
        </h6>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Psuedopods</h5>
        <p>
          Pseudopods are temporary extensions of an organism's body that it uses
          to catch prey or move along. Amoebas are a type of organism well-known
          for its use of pseudopods. If you've ever seen an amoeba moving,
          you've seen it using pseudopods to extend itself forward and engulf
          its prey.

          Here, you can clearly see the different forms of movement. Now that we
          know how they move, let's take a closer look at some of the most
          common microscopic organisms you might find living in water.
        </h6>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Ostracods</h5>
        <p>
          Ostracods are tiny crustaceans that live in both freshwater and
          saltwater environments. They get their name from their hard,
          protective outer shell, which resembles an oyster shell. Ostracods
          vary widely in size, but most are roughly 1mm long.

        </h6>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Rotifers</h5>
        <p>
          Rotifers are another type of small freshwater creature. They get their
          name from the wheel-like structures (called rotors) on either side of
          their head that they use for locomotion. Rotifers are scavengers and
          will eat just about anything smaller than themselves, including other
          rotifers!
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Nematodes</h5>
        <p>
          Nematodes are one of the most diverse groups of creatures on Earth —
          there are an estimated 1 million species of nematode! They can be
          found in virtually every ecosystem on the planet, including freshwater
          ecosystems like ponds. Nematodes vary widely in size, but most measure
          less than 1mm long. Because they're so small, they often go unnoticed
          by us humans; however, they play an essential role in the food chain
          as predators and prey.

          An Unseen World All Around Us
        </h5>
        <p>
          The next time you take a walk outside or go for a swim on a hot summer
          day, take a moment to think about all the different types of creatures
          inhabiting the water around you — you may be surprised at just how
          many different kinds there are! And although you can't see them with
          your naked eye, each one plays a crucial role in keeping its ecosystem
          healthy and balanced. Thanks for learning more about the microscopic
          world today. We look forward to sharing more information about
          microorganisms in our upcoming blogs!
