          Have You Ever Wondered What's Swimming Around in a Drop of Water?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Microscopic organisms, that's what! In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at some of the most common microscopic organisms found in water sources like ponds and learn more about their unique movements. Keep reading to find out more!         
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">A Fantastic Microscopic World</h5>
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered what's going on when looking at a drop of water under a microscope? It turns out that a whole world of activity is happening that you can't see with the naked eye. Using a traditional microscope or our shadow scope, you can ID certain microscopic life forms in a small water sample by their movement patterns. 
          This can give you a much better picture of the underlying health of that particular water ecosystem. Water is essential for all life on Earth, and we need to be good stewards of this precious resource. By understanding the microscopic world in a drop of water, we can learn more about how to protect our planet and its many diverse ecosystems.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Microorganisms Everywhere</h5>
        <p>
          All water on Earth contains microscopic organisms, even if it looks clean. These tiny aquatic creatures are a vital part of the ecosystem and play a role in decomposing organic matter, filtering water, and providing food for other animals.
          While some microscopic organisms are harmful to humans and can cause diseases, others are actually beneficial. For example, certain microorganisms found in dirt help plants grow by enriching the soil through their natural biological processes.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">How These Little Creatures Get Around</h5>
        <p>
          One of the most fascinating things about microscopic organisms is the way they move. Depending on the type of organism, they may use flagella, cilia, or pseudopods to get around.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Flagella</h5>
        <p>Flagella are long, whiplike appendages that some microscopic organisms use for propulsion. You may be familiar with flagella from studying bacteria in science class — many bacteria have a single flagellum at one end that they use to move about.</p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Cilia</h5>
        <p>
          Cilia are shorter than flagella and are often found in arrays along the sides of an organism's body. They can beat back and forth in unison to create a wave-like motion that propels the organism through its environment.
        </p>

            <h6 class="caption">
              In this example video taken on a shadow scope, can you see where the flagella are and how they move? Hint, this organism is a stentor!
            </h6>
       <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Psuedopods</h5>
       <p>
        Pseudopods are temporary extensions of an organism's body that it uses to catch prey or move along. Amoebas are a type of organism well-known for its use of pseudopods. If you've ever seen an amoeba moving, you've seen it using pseudopods to extend itself forward and engulf its prey.
       </p>
       <iframe class="blog-video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PYKzwpKyUn0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
       <h6 class="caption">
        Here, you can clearly see the different forms of movement.
        Now that we know how they move, let's take a closer look at some of the most common microscopic organisms you might find living in water.
       </h6>
       <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Ostracods</h5>
       <p>
        Ostracods are tiny crustaceans that live in both freshwater and saltwater environments. They get their name from their hard, protective outer shell, which resembles an oyster shell. Ostracods vary widely in size, but most are roughly 1mm long.
       </p>

       <h6 class="caption">
        Notice the rotifer inching along toward the bottom.
       </h6>
       <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Rotifers</h5>
       <p>
        Rotifers are another type of small freshwater creature. They get their name from the wheel-like structures (called rotors) on either side of their head that they use for locomotion. Rotifers are scavengers and will eat just about anything smaller than themselves, including other rotifers!
       </p>
       <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Nematodes</h5>
       <p>
        Nematodes are one of the most diverse groups of creatures on Earth — there are an estimated 1 million species of nematode! They can be found in virtually every ecosystem on the planet, including freshwater ecosystems like ponds. Nematodes vary widely in size, but most measure less than 1mm long. Because they're so small, they often go unnoticed by us humans; however, they play an essential role in the food chain as predators and prey.
       </p>
       <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">An Unseen World All Around Us</h5>
       <p>
        The next time you take a walk outside or go for a swim on a hot summer day, take a moment to think about all the different types of creatures inhabiting the water around you — you may be surprised at just how many different kinds there are! And although you can't see them with your naked eye, each one plays a crucial role in keeping its ecosystem healthy and balanced. Thanks for learning more about the microscopic world today.
        We look forward to sharing more information about microorganisms in our upcoming blogs!

          <h3>Building a Shadow Scope for Under $20</h3>
          <h4>Feb. 8, 2022</h4>
        </span>
        <p>
         One of our research assistants, Delaney, set out to build a Shadow 
         Scope at home from items found around the home or items purchased items 
         purchased in-store. She was able to successfully build a scope for
         under $20! We call it the Limeade Scope, check it out:
