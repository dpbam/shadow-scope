        <h4 class="blog-paragraph-title">What is a water flea (daphnia)?</h4>
        <p>
          Water fleas, also known as daphnia, are a genus of small aquatic
          crustaceans that are great for studying freshwater ecosystems. They
          can be located all around the world, from the great lakes to smaller
          lakes and ponds. These tiny animals are common in North America and
          Europe. There are several species within this group, including Daphnia
          pulex, Daphnia magna, and Daphnia cucullata. While all the daphnia
          species within this genus share some traits, such as their size and
          segmented body shape, they also have distinct characteristics that
          make them unique.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, Daphnia pulex is known for being the first species of
          crustacean to have its genome sequenced, while Daphnia magna is
          typically found in less polluted freshwater lakes. All water fleas
          feed on microscopic organisms like algae, bacteria, or yeast and serve
          as an important live food source for many animals that thrive on
          freshwater lakes. Kids love to study these tiny creatures as it can
          easily be done at home with a sample taken from a shallow pond or lake
          nearby! So whether you're looking to explore your local ecosystem or
          if you're just looking for a great science project - investigating
          water flea daphnia with a shadow scope is always fun!
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          The physical features of the water flea daphnia
        </h5>
        <p>
          Water fleas are found in almost any body of freshwater, and the most
          well-studied species is Daphnia pulex. They reproduce quickly and can
          often be seen swimming on the surface of ponds. Water fleas have an
          easy-to-spot external anatomy consisting of a single compound eye (yes
          - they are a cyclops!), antennae, and a brood chamber that contains
          eggs or embryos. While they all look generally similar, one species -
          the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) - stands out with its
          extended tail spine that gives it an almost alien appearance. Water
          fleas come in a variety of colors due to their carapace pigmentation;
          these range from dark brown and green to orange, yellow, and even
          pink! Overall, the physical features of water fleas make them easily
          recognizable among aquatic life. These fascinating creatures are both
          incredibly abundant and incredibly diverse! ​​​​Their unique physical
          features help us better understand their life cycle as well as our own
          global environment.

          Microorganisms Everywhere
        </h5>
        <p>
          All water on Earth contains microscopic organisms, even if it looks
          clean. These tiny aquatic creatures are a vital part of the ecosystem
          and play a role in decomposing organic matter, filtering water, and
          providing food for other animals. While some microscopic organisms are
          harmful to humans and can cause diseases, others are actually
          beneficial. For example, certain microorganisms found in dirt help
          plants grow by enriching the soil through their natural biological
          processes.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          What the water flea daphnia eats
        </h5>
        <p>
          Water fleas (daphnia) are filter feeders, which means that they filter
          their environment for food. They primarily feed on bacteria and yeasts
          in their aquatic environment, but they will also consume single-celled
          algae and small organic particulates from decomposed plants. To filter
          their food, the water flea uses a set of unique antenna-like features
          called "bristles." These bristles create whirlpools that enable
          daphnia to capture and filter out edible particles from the water.
          Daphnia will then use these particles as a source of nutrition. Once
          consumed, the nutrients are used to grow tissue and produce energy for
          reproduction and movement. By eating what's available in their
          environment, water fleas help to keep the body of water clean and able
          to sustain other species that inhabit it. This is one of many
          fascinating behaviors that you can observe under the shadow scope
          while studying these creatures!
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          How the water flea daphnia lives and reproduces
        </h5>
        <p>
          The life cycle of the water flea, or daphnia, is quite fascinating!
          Daphnia starts life out as eggs that hatch in the spring when the
          water begins to warm and conditions are appropriate for them to
          survive. When these larvae hatch, they take in lots of food and molt
          their exoskeleton several times before reaching adulthood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adults can reproduce using a variety of means - one is called
          parthenogenesis. This happens when females lay eggs without mating
          with males. These fertile eggs then mature within a brood chamber made
          of hardened parts of the female's body called a carapace. As
          environmental conditions change, females will sometimes lay resting
          eggs that have protective shells so they can rest until optimal
          conditions return.
        </p>
        <p>
          They can remain dormant during stressful environmental conditions like
          drought and extreme temperatures but will hatch when more suitable
          conditions present themselves - making this tiny creature incredibly
          resilient!
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          The benefits of having water fleas in your pond or aquarium
        </h5>
        <p>
          If you have a pond or fish tank, adding a few water fleas, or daphnia,
          can bring loads of benefits! Not only do they provide food for larger
          animals like fish and frogs, but they also help to maintain the
          cleanliness and health of the environment. The tiny creatures act like
          natural filters in the water, trapping debris, bacteria, and other
          microorganisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          As if all that wasn't enough - these unsung heroes will help keep your
          pond or aquarium looking its best too! Daphnia feed on algae growths
          which can give your water a dull green hue and accumulate on surfaces
          over time. Thanks to the power of daphnia, your aquatic home may stay
          fresher and clearer.

          Fun facts about water fleas:
        </h5>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            Though they're very small, water fleas can actually be quite
            long-lived. Some individual water fleas have been known to live for
            up to one hundred days!
          </li>
          <li>
            Male water fleas can mate with females to produce eggs that can
            survive in harsh conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many people who keep fish practice daphnia culturing so they can use
            the fleas as a live food source for their pets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scientists also study water fleas because they are very sensitive to
            polluted water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Water fleas are also interesting because they can "evolve" like a
            pokemon for battle in the presence of predators. In other words,
            when they're around predators, they can grow horns and armor to
            protect themselves!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So the next time you're near a body of water, take a closer look - you
          might just see some tiny water fleas swimming around.

          A Fantastic Microscopic World
        </h5>
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered what's going on when looking at a drop of water
          under a microscope? It turns out that a whole world of activity is
          happening that you can't see with the naked eye. Using a traditional
          microscope or our shadow scope, you can ID certain microscopic life
          forms in a small water sample by their movement patterns. This can
          give you a much better picture of the underlying health of that
          particular water ecosystem. Water is essential for all life on Earth,
          and we need to be good stewards of this precious resource. By

          Microorganisms Everywhere
        </h5>
        <p>
          All water on Earth contains microscopic organisms, even if it looks
          clean. These tiny aquatic creatures are a vital part of the ecosystem
          and play a role in decomposing organic matter, filtering water, and
          providing food for other animals. While some microscopic organisms are
          harmful to humans and can cause diseases, others are actually

        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">
          How These Little Creatures Get Around
        </h5>
        <p>
          One of the most fascinating things about microscopic organisms is the
          way they move. Depending on the type of organism, they may use
          flagella, cilia, or pseudopods to get around.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Flagella</h5>
        <p>
          Flagella are long, whiplike appendages that some microscopic organisms
          use for propulsion. You may be familiar with flagella from studying
          bacteria in science class — many bacteria have a single flagellum at
          one end that they use to move about.
        </p>
        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Cilia</h5>
        <p>
          Cilia are shorter than flagella and are often found in arrays along
          the sides of an organism's body. They can beat back and forth in
          unison to create a wave-like motion that propels the organism through
          its environment.

        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Psuedopods</h5>
        <p>
          Pseudopods are temporary extensions of an organism's body that it uses
          to catch prey or move along. Amoebas are a type of organism well-known
          for its use of pseudopods. If you've ever seen an amoeba moving,
          you've seen it using pseudopods to extend itself forward and engulf
          its prey.

        <p>
          Ostracods are tiny crustaceans that live in both freshwater and
          saltwater environments. They get their name from their hard,
          protective outer shell, which resembles an oyster shell. Ostracods
          vary widely in size, but most are roughly 1mm long.

        <p>
          Rotifers are another type of small freshwater creature. They get their
          name from the wheel-like structures (called rotors) on either side of
          their head that they use for locomotion. Rotifers are scavengers and
          will eat just about anything smaller than themselves, including other
          rotifers!

        <h5 class="blog-paragraph-title-secondary">Nematodes</h5>
        <p>
          Nematodes are one of the most diverse groups of creatures on Earth —
          there are an estimated 1 million species of nematode! They can be
          found in virtually every ecosystem on the planet, including freshwater
          ecosystems like ponds. Nematodes vary widely in size, but most measure
          less than 1mm long. Because they're so small, they often go unnoticed
          by us humans; however, they play an essential role in the food chain
          as predators and prey.

          <h3>Bennett Elementary Event!</h3>
          <h4>Apr. 22, 2022</h4>
        </span>
        <p>
          On Friday, Tim and Delaney visited Bennett Elementary to give the 5th
          grade students experience with the Shadow Scope! It was a great debut
          of the Shadow Scope in the classroom. We can't wait for our next class
          event.

          <h3>Building a Shadow Scope for Under $20</h3>
          <h4>Feb. 8, 2022</h4>
        </span>
        <p>
          One of our research assistants, Delaney, set out to build a Shadow
          Scope at home from items found around the home or items purchased
          items purchased in-store. She was able to successfully build a scope
          for under $20! We call it the Limeade Scope, check it out:
